# Background
This project applies customer segmentation to the new-car market using survey responses in car_data.csv. Each row marks a unique respondent with:
- Ideal_price: Intended spend (in increments of $1,000)
- Q1-Q17: 1-7 Likert-scale agreement with statements about technology, quality/reliability, driving experience (ride, handling, performance), style/self-expression, and domestic/heritage/character.
- Purchase (0/1): Binary observation; equals 1 if the customer purchased a car within six months after completing the survey and equals 0 otherwise. 

The objective of this project is to **identify distinct consumer segments** from psychographic elements and willingness to pay to inform product, pricing, and marketing strategy.


# Executive Summary
Four distinct clusters emerged with clear psychographic and price-tolerance differences.

- Cluster 1 - Tech-Forward Stylists (21%): Leads on **trending style/design and self-expression (Q9-14)**, followed by moderate interest in **latest tech and the driving experience** (Q1-Q8). They also show an above-average ideal price ($40k) and place less weight on heritage/character cues (Q15-Q17).
Actions: Design and feature-led creative; couple language supporting advanced tech with sleek visuals.

- Cluster 2 - Value-First Convenience Seekers (43%): Defined by cost-sensitive buyers with a **low ideal price** ($20k) and a **lower interest in tech and driving performance** (Q1-Q8). They are also below average on style/design and self-expression (Q9-Q14), and show limited pull from heritage/character (Q15-Q17). Prioritize affordability and practicality above all else.
Actions: Base models; messaging around reliability of price and cost of ownership.

- Cluster 3 - Heritage & Character Loyalists (24%): Highest on **domestic/heritage/character** (Q15-Q17) with a high ideal price ($60k). They sit near average on style/self-expression (Q9-Q14) but lower on latest tech and driving performance (Q1-Q8). 
Actions: Emphasis on brand storytelling with authenticity cues; push limited/heritage editions; niche community/cult following content; avoid emphasis on specs.

- Cluster 4 - Performance-Reliability Realists (11%): Strongest on **latest tech, quality/reliability, and ride/handling/performance** (Q1-Q8). Ideal price sits around average ($30k), while style/self-expression (Q9-Q14) fall below average.
Actions: Feature-led marketing and proof-heavy marketing (safety, reliability, handling); pragmatic tone and language.


# Methodology
**(1) Preprocess data:** Standardized features (Ideal_Price + Likert) using StandardScale to equalize scales

**(2) Determine optimal k value:**
- Ran k-means (scikit-learn) with k=2 to k=10
- Assessed fit by using elbow method to spot drop in within-cluster sum of squares
- K=4 displayed a clear elbow with a strong drop in within-SS as well as a +16.027pp increase in between/total% (explained variance) from k=3.

</p>


**(3) Ran the K-means algorithm with k=4**
- Produced cluster centers in both standardized units and original units
- Validation: k=4 displayed interpretable cluster profiles sanity checks and stability (re-seed/nearby k)

# Interpretation & Profiles
For each cluster, I interpreted standardized loading to identify defining attributes and translated those patterns into psychographic/price tolerance profiles. I have listed actionable next steps (product, pricing, marketing) for each cluster.


**Cluster 1 — Tech-Forward Stylists (21%)**
Profile: Lead on trending style/design & self-expression (Q9–Q14). The car is part of personal identity, followed by a strong interest in having the latest tech and enjoying the driving experience (Q1–Q8). They also show above-average Ideal_Price [+$9.0k vs avg], and are least driven by heritage/character cues (Q15–Q17).
Positioning & creative: Design-first storytelling with visible tech; sleek visuals, UI/UX demos, “always up to date.”
Product & pricing: Premium trims; tech + aesthetics bundles; consider OTA/subscription features.
Next tests: A/B “latest tech” vs “style/design” ads; measure CTR→CVR and premium-trim mix.

**Cluster 2 — Value-First Convenience Seekers (43%)**
Profile: Low Ideal_Price (cost-sensitive) comes first. They show less interest in tech and driving performance (Q1–Q8) and sit below average on style/design & self-expression (Q9–Q14), with limited pull from heritage/character (Q15–Q17). Practicality and total cost dominate.
Positioning & creative: Lead with affordability, transparent pricing/financing, warranty and fuel-economy claims; remove friction in the path to buy.
Product & pricing: Base/entry trims, value packs, service incentives; emphasize TCO and reliability.
Next tests: Offer-led experiments (APR, cash back) by segment; track uptake vs margin.

**Cluster 3 — Heritage & Character Loyalists (24%)**
Profile: Highest on domestic/heritage/character (Q15–Q17) and premium price tolerance [+$28.9k vs avg]. They’re near average on style/self-expression (Q9–Q14) but lower on latest tech and drive/performance (Q1–Q8). Identity and provenance matter more than spec sheets.
Positioning & creative: Brand storytelling, craftsmanship, provenance; community/cult-following content; lean into authenticity.
Product & pricing: Limited/heritage editions, collectible options, branded accessories, loyalty programs.
Next tests: Story-led vs spec-led creatives; measure engagement, accessory attach, and high-margin package mix.

**Cluster 4 — Performance-Reliability Realists (11%)**
Profile (what defines them): Strongest on tech + quality/reliability + ride/handling/performance (Q1–Q8). Ideal_Price is about average [≈ $X.Xk], while style/self-expression (Q9–Q14) and heritage (Q15–Q17) are less influential. They value how the car drives and holds up.
Positioning & creative: Proof-heavy messaging — safety data, reliability stats, handling/road-feel demos; pragmatic tone.
Product & pricing: Mid→upper functional trims (performance & safety packages); extended-warranty angles.
Next tests: “Handling/safety” vs “value/comfort” narratives; track test-drive bookings and close rate.

1-2 line names + narratives
Report cluster centers in both standardized units and original units (Likert & $), listing attributes in descending order of each cluster’s strongest loadings to emphasize what defines them.

Compute segment size (% of respondents) and Ideal_Price deltas vs overall mean for price tolerance.

(Optional validation) Compare Purchase rates by segment post-hoc to check directional lift.
